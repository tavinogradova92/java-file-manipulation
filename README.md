# Java file manipulation and project structure

## In this project I could implement the following features:

* Java project with user interaction.

* File service reading through the resources and getting the information about them.
    * Getting the list of all files.
    * Getting the list of files by their extensions.
    * Getting the info about a txt file: 
    the name, size, number of lines, search for a specific word,
    counting occurences of this word in the text.  


* Logging service used for each of the above mentioned manipulations to log the user friendly data about the date, time and duration of each function call in a separate logging file.

* Manual work on the structure of the project to show the understanding of how such a project should be compiled without any IDE.
    1. First you should run the following command to compile all .java files into .class files on /out/ folder.

    2. Then you should run the command to create a single .jar file from /out/
